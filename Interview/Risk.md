## What is the primary reason most companies havent fixed their vulnerabilities?

Companies dont actually care as much about security as they claim to otherwise we would have better salaries and bigger market instead we have a ton of unfixed things and more tests being performed and I am okay with that challenge

## What is the goal of information security within an organization

To help the organization succeed and that security is there for the company and not the other way around 
-Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of company information

## If you were to start a job as head engineer or CSO at a Fortune 500 company due to the previous guy being fired for incompetence, what would your priorities be? Imagine you start on day one with no knowledge of the environment.

-Where is the important data?
-Who interacts with the data?
-Network diagrams?
-What is being logged/audited?
-Previous vuln assessments?

## As a corporate Information Security professional, whatâ€™s more important to focus on: threats or vulnerabilities?

This one is opinion-based, and we all have opinions. Focus on the quality of the argument put forth rather than whether or not they chose the same as you, necessarily. My answer to this is that vulnerabilities should usually be the main focus since we in the corporate world usually have little control over the threats.

Another way to take that, however, is to say that the threats (in terms of vectors) will always remain the same, and that the vulnerabilities we are fixing are only the known ones. Therefore we should be applying defense-in-depth based on threat modeling in addition to just keeping ourselves up to date.

Both are true, of course; the key is to hear what they have to say on the matter.
